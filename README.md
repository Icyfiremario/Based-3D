# Based 3D

## About
Based 3D is a 3D game engine that uses Vulkan and GLFW. Like my other game engine, this is outdated and will be replaced by Based-Engine-CMake.

## Status
Creates a window and renders a sphere using the wavefront format[^2].

## Todo
- [ ] Create game functions and standard features[^1].
- [ ] Get the 2D branch up to date. (Descriptors, UBO, etc.) [^3]

## how to use
Based 3D is not currently ready to be used as a game engine but it will be in the future.

## Use requirements
- Vulkan SDK
- GLFW
- experience with C++
- Visual Studio 2022 with The Desktop C++ development package installed


## Footnotes
[^1]: This includes the Entity component system, movement, animation, sound, weapons, etc.
[^2]: The files are renamed to *.wobj because of issues with visual studio
[^3]: My current 2d game engine I will most likely replace with the 2D implementation of this.
