# Based 3D

## About
Based 3D is a 3D game engine that uses Vulkan and GLFW[^1]. Like my other game engine, this is an ongoing project and will be updated in the future.

## Status
Creates a window and prints out information about extensions, what physical device was used, and the code sizes of the shader files.

## Todo
- [ ] Create standard graphical capabilities.
- [ ] Create game functions and standard features[^2].

## how to use
Based 3D is not currently ready to be used as a game engine but it will be in the future.

## Use requirements[^3]
- Vulkan SDK
- GLFW[^2]
- experience with C++
- Visual Studio 2022 with The Desktop C++ development package installed


## Footnotes
[^1]: I might switch the engine to use SDL2 just so it's more similar to [Based Engine](https://github.com/Icyfiremario/Based-Engine).
[^2]: This includes the Entity component system, movement, animation, sound, weapons, etc.
[^3]: I am including these for the future even though the engine is not in a currently usable state.
